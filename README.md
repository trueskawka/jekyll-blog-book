# So you want a Jekyll blog?

This book is a byproduct of creating my personal website and blog in Jekyll. Some of the issues I had to deal with made it very specific:

* I am using GitHub pages to host my website and thus I can't use most of the Jekyll extensions, or rather I have to push a static website to my GitHub repo

* I needed to have at least two language versions, as I am Polish and some of my loved ones don't speak English - also, some recruiters in Poland don't really like to use it either
* I wanted to have all my website stuff in one place, which means using it for:
  * a professional website with CV and portfolio
  * a sort-of-professional blog
  * blogs dedicated to specific circumstances, like travelling 6850 kilometers from Warsaw to NYC

* I wanted to create my own little plugins and extensions, including:
  * a GitHub-like calendar for my posts, which required a plugin to generate a subpage for every day and category
